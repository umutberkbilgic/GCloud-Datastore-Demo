# GCloud-Datastore-Demo
This python console app communicates with Googe Cloud Datastore module. Hurray serverless architecture I say.

Dependancies: virtualenv, google.cloud.datastore, pip also helps to set it up

Also set environment variable "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS" to your <KEY>.json file you got from Google Cloud App Engine certificate. (or $ sudo gcloud auth login)

Very much tweakable and expandable, very much work in progress. 

TODO:

incooparate into a node.js FaaS or App engine deployment.
